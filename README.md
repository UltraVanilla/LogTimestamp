# LogTimestamp

A spigot plugin to log the current server timestamp to the console and to any user that has the `logtimestamp.login` permission.

Why? Minecraft log files are fragile to analyze because they do not contain a full timestamp, and they do not indicate the timezone. This plugin should hopefully make the timestamps in your log more machine-readable.
